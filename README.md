## Idea 
Facial skin problems are one of the important things to pay attention to, because it is related to a person's appearance. So if there are problems with facial skin, it often lowers a person's self-confidence. However, the costs required for treatment or consultation regarding facial skin problems are quite expensive. Therefore to make it easier and we have to develop an application that helps users detect facial skin diseases. They are experiencing and then provide recommendations on what steps need to be taken to overcome facial skin problems.
## Dataset
We collected our [Dataset](https://github.com/KanzulF/BangkitCapstone2022/blob/Machine-Learning/Dataset.txt)
various skin face disease from kaggle. We got 625 skin face disease image data in total and there is the distribution.
1.	Acne : 125
2.	Actinic Keratosis : 125
3.	Basal Cell Caricona : 125
4.	Ezcema : 125
5.	Rosacea : 125                                                                                                                                               
## Technology
To develop this machine learning model we use Convolutional Neural Network algorithm first we try some algorithm and found the best model by using InceptionResNetV2 as transfer learning. We also use google collab notebook and  some python library in this project, including tensorflow, matplotib, numpy, keras, pathlib etc. After then we save our [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/folders/1dI4LQVUrF8kmNIfZFS_okDj0dtjWIV5y) to h5 format.
